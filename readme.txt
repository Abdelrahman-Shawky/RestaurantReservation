Assumptions about our program:

1)Only 3 main course dishes and 2 appetizers and 2 desserts are served in the restaurant.
1)All details which are read by the code are found in the .XML file, so the .XML must be attached for the program to run and operate correcty.
2)The .XML file is also where the code writes and saves the customers' new reservations.
3)All background images used must be found inside of the source file for the code to locate them and use them.
4)All tables are initialy not reserved at the start of the day.
5)Tables are reserved only once for the whole day.
6)If you don't have a customer account you can sign up.
